# Netflix-static-clone
## 📝 About the Project
This project is a static replica of the Netflix homepage (circa 2023), created using only HTML5 and CSS3. It focuses on the layout, design, and responsiveness of the official Netflix landing page. There is no backend or JavaScript—this is strictly a frontend UI clone for learning and portfolio purposes.

It replicates sections such as the top banner, call-to-action area, frequently asked questions (FAQ), footer, and more, to closely match the look and feel of the Netflix interface.
